  I have had a serious interest in technology since middle school. That passion, which started with assembling computers, setting up forums, and designing simple HTML pages, has now turned into building smart home systems, creating IoT devices, designing complex websites, and working on software architecture. I started my professional career in 2015, and I have continued to play a role in projects since then. In addition to my professional work, I also work on my own hobby projects in order to keep up with new technologies and turn the ideas in my mind into reality. As much as I can, as much as I have time, I will try to document some of my work through this site, share my knowledge and try to help people who are as curious as I am. If you want to consult about your projects, or if you have any questions about the topics I write about, you can reach me via e-mail.
